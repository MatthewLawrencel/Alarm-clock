# Alarm-clock

Here we are creating the alarm clock which will be having time setup of timings(ie, 12 hours), where the clock which is present at the top will keep on running. Where it displays time in the format of HH:MM:SS.
Here the code is written to alert the user with the alert message on the screen and with the audio which i used in the code. We can set the alarm with the differt times but, we can't create an alarm with the same time.If we try to set alarm of same time it doesn't accept it.
